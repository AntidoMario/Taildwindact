                    <p class="text-base mt-4">While the games in the series have had several narrative arcs, Ubisoft views the series as currently having three periods of development and design philosophy. Until 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate, the franchise was structured around single-player content, and while centering on open world spaces and several role-playing elements, were more action-adventure and stealth-oriented. Period two, covering from Assassin's Creed Origins to Assassin's Creed Mirage, brought in more role-playing elements and live-service features to increase player engagement. Period three will launch with Assassin's Creed: Codename Red, using lessons from the second period of development to make engrossing single-player games similar to the original</p>

To win the match, teams work together to destroy a structure called the Nexus in the enemy team's base, bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets.[5] Unlike the PC version of League, inhibitors and Nexus turrets were removed, and the Nexus itself is able to attack target units.[10] The mode has a ranked competitive ladder with a matchmaking system determining the player's skill level. There are currently 11 tiers; from least to most skilled, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Emerald, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster, Challenger, and Sovereign.[11]</p>
